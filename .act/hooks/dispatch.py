#
# Purpose: Single entry point for every hook event this template wires into the assistant's
#          harness (currently PreToolUse, PostToolUse and SessionStart). One script per event would
#          scatter the same "read stdin, load actlib, check config" boilerplate across files;
#          dispatch.py does that once and hands off to one handler per event. The checks/notes
#          themselves live one module per check under .act/hooks/checks/ (see checks/__init__.py);
#          dispatch.py stays the thin entry point that reads the payload and runs them in a fixed
#          order.
#
#          PreToolUse runs the checks in _PRE_TOOL_USE_CHECKS, in that order, first denial wins:
#          the template write-guard (checks.write_guard.check_write_guard), the no-sub-sub-agents
#          guard (checks.nesting_guard.check_worker_nesting_guard, R-role-worker), and the
#          per-worker write-scope guard (checks.write_scope.check_worker_write_scope,
#          R-cost-delegate) — a worker may only write where its assignment's `Write scope:` line
#          allows.
#
#          To add a new PreToolUse check: write checks/<name>.py exporting a function
#          check_<name>(payload: dict) -> int (0 = allow, 2 = deny — print the reason to stderr
#          before returning 2, same as every existing check) and add ("<name>", "check_<name>")
#          to _PRE_TOOL_USE_CHECKS at the position it should run in. A listed module that does
#          not exist yet is skipped. Observers (event log, usage counter) work the same way via
#          _OBSERVERS, with observe(event, payload) -> None (checks/board_refresh.py, for instance,
#          regenerates the board after a PostToolUse of a git merge/pull/rebase/switch/...); for
#          every event but PreToolUse they see it before any check runs and never block — for
#          PreToolUse specifically they run *after* the checks instead (see the "PreToolUse" paragraph under Usage below).
#
#          PostToolUse runs every entry in _POST_TOOL_USE_NOTES — signature
#          note_<name>(payload: dict) -> str | None — collecting whatever text each one returns
#          (None means "nothing to say", the common case) and, only if at least one note came back,
#          printing a single hookSpecificOutput JSON object on stdout (see "Output format" below).
#          Unlike PreToolUse's checks, notes never block: a missing module is skipped silently (not
#          built yet, same convention as _PRE_TOOL_USE_CHECKS), and an exception while loading or
#          calling one is caught, logged as one line on stderr, and skipped — the remaining notes
#          still run, and the JSON on stdout, if any, stays well-formed either way. This is the
#          channel a check reaches for when it needs the assistant to actually see a hint: unlike a
#          PreToolUse check's plain-text stdout (transcript-only, never fed back to the model — see
#          checks/encoding_hint.py's and checks/worker_cap.py's own header comments for the
#          research behind that), PostToolUse's hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext is documented
#          to reach the model. A check that also needs to *deny* a call still does that from
#          PreToolUse (exit 2 + stderr, the only channel confirmed to reach the model for that
#          event) — PostToolUse's notes are for the non-blocking half of the same checks only.
#
#          PostToolUseFailure runs the very same _POST_TOOL_USE_NOTES list, the same way (a live
#          probe): when every one of a worker's tool calls fails (e.g. every Read
#          errors because the file does not exist), the harness only ever fires PostToolUseFailure,
#          never PostToolUse — a worker that never gets a single successful call also never got its
#          cap-reached hint under the old PostToolUse-only wiring, silently. Confirmed against the
#          hook docs (code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks, fetched 2026-09-23): PostToolUseFailure's
#          hookSpecificOutput does support additionalContext, hookEventName "PostToolUseFailure".
#          Deliberately NOT given the same pre-import, pre-observer fast exit that PostToolUse's
#          early block above has (see that block's own comment): that exit runs before
#          _run_observers, which is safe for PostToolUse only because the observers that react to
#          a plain "PostToolUse" event (board_refresh) only care about tools in
#          _POST_TOOL_USE_TOOLS (Bash, PowerShell), which the early block lets through — but checks.event_log.observe *does* have a dedicated
#          PostToolUseFailure branch (the "[error]" log line, every failure, any tool, worker or
#          not) that must keep firing regardless of which tool failed. Skipping straight past that
#          would silently drop failure logging for every tool outside _POST_TOOL_USE_TOOLS (Read,
#          Grep, Glob, WebFetch, ...) — the opposite of what this fix is for. PostToolUseFailure
#          therefore always goes through the normal event path (imports, observers, then notes);
#          only the notes themselves stay as cheap as PostToolUse's (each note_<name> already
#          returns None fast for a call it does not care about, see worker_cap.note_worker_cap et
#          al.). .act/bridges/settings.hooks.json's PostToolUseFailure entry was `async: true`
#          (needed only for the event-log write, which never needs to reach the model) — switched
#          to synchronous here so the JSON this now also prints is reliably delivered, one hook
#          entry doing both jobs rather than a second one added alongside it.
#
#          The PreToolUse hook fires for every tool (settings.hooks.json: the Edit/Write/Bash
#          entry, the Agent|Task entry and a third entry for all other tool names, e.g.
#          PowerShell, Read, MCP tools) — each check filters the tool names it cares about.
#          PostToolUse fires for every tool too, via a single unrestricted matcher (no need to
#          split it the way PreToolUse's matcher is split — that split exists so future PreToolUse
#          checks *could* be wired per tool-name group; every PostToolUse note today applies
#          uniformly regardless of tool, so one entry suffices without risking a double call).
#
#          SessionStart is a single combined handler (checks.session.refresh_session) rather than
#          a list — its sub-steps (inbox count, bridge refresh, template-awareness notes,
#          orchestrator-rules delivery, ...) are each their own best-effort note or side effect
#          gated by their own docs/ai/config.md row, not independent pass/fail gates, so a list
#          with "first denial wins" semantics does not fit it the way it fits PreToolUse.
#
# Usage:
#   python .act/hooks/dispatch.py <event>
#   python .act/hooks/dispatch.py UserPromptSubmit --act-check
#   ... with the hook's JSON payload piped in on stdin (may be empty or malformed; handled).
#
#   <event> is the hook event name. "PreToolUse" runs the checks, "PostToolUse" and
#   "PostToolUseFailure" both run the notes, "SessionStart" the session handler; every event but
#   "PreToolUse" (these three and e.g. SubagentStart, SubagentStop, UserPromptSubmit, Notification,
#   SessionEnd) goes to the observers first, unconditionally. "PreToolUse" is the one exception
#   exception: its observers run *after* its checks, and only for a call the checks
#   allow — see _run_pre_tool_use_observers' own docstring for why a call the checks deny must
#   never reach usage.py's role/skill/script/checklist counters (it never happened, from the
#   counters' point of view), while checks.event_log.observe still runs for it, marked as a denial
#   (R-safe-block: every block is logged). Anything else exits 0 — an unknown event must never
#   break the caller's hook chain. "UserPromptSubmit --act-check" is a second, separate invocation
#   of this same event (its own synchronous entry in .act/bridges/settings.hooks.json, alongside
#   the plain "UserPromptSubmit" one, which stays async and unchanged) — see the fast-path block
#   near the top of this file, before the heavy imports, and "Output format" below.
#
# Output format:
#   PreToolUse:   exit 0 (allow) or exit 2 with a one-line reason on stderr (deny) — the
#                 harness convention for "block this tool call and show the assistant why".
#   PostToolUse / PostToolUseFailure: exit 0 always (notes never block); if at least one note
#                 module returned text, one line on stdout: {"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName":
#                 "PostToolUse"|"PostToolUseFailure", "additionalContext": "<note>\n<note>..."}} —
#                 multiple notes joined with "\n", hookEventName matching whichever of the two
#                 events this run is for.
#                 Nothing printed at all when no note module had anything to say.
#   SessionStart: one JSON object on stdout: `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` holds
#                 the lines below, kept under the 10,000-character cap (above it Claude Code
#                 moves a hook output into a file and shows the model a 2,000-character
#                 preview), and a top-level `systemMessage` holds one line for the human (rule
#                 files loaded per `rules.py --imports`, chat language, inbox entries to
#                 process). The lines: an optional
#                 block of orchestrator-only rules, one line per rule plus where the full text
#                 lives (main session only, never seen by a sub-agent), zero or more "[act] note: ..."
#                 lines (a changed/unrefreshable bridge, an unresolvable tier/reasoning value, a
#                 project .act/ pulled in without update.py — each best-effort and independently
#                 gated, see checks.session.refresh_session()), then the fixed-format status line
#                 "[act] branch=<name>[ · inbox: <n> waiting][ · ideas: <n> new][ · feedback due] ·
#                 board updated[ · rules: <n>][ · role-bridges refreshed: <n>]", and finally, as a deliberate postscript after
#                 that status line, an optional "a template update is available" note — always a
#                 *previous* SessionStart's finding, consumed from .act-local/update-check-
#                 result.json, never something looked up during this run (see
#                 checks.session._spawn_update_check_worker: the actual `git ls-remote` runs
#                 detached, in the background, so it can never delay this session — a SessionStart
#                 hook has a fixed timeout, and an unreachable template source measured at 21s
#                 against a 5s subprocess timeout before this fix, see that function's docstring).
#                 Also re-derives the model/effort frontmatter of every existing
#                 .claude/agents/*.md role bridge (tiers.py), leaving the rest of each file
#                 untouched; exit 0 always — a session start must never fail the session over a
#                 mechanism error.
#
#   "_update-check-worker" <root>: internal only, never a real harness hook event — this is what
#                 checks.session._spawn_update_check_worker() launches as a detached background
#                 process (see main() below). Not documented to the harness, not something a hook
#                 config ever names.
#
#   "_security-scan-worker" <root> [<state-hash> <lock-file>...]: the same kind of internal-only
#                 event, launched by checks.session._spawn_security_scan_worker() — with the root
#                 alone for the daily dependency-vulnerability scan at session start (security-
#                 check: deps/full), with a state hash and the lock files one commit
#                 touches for checks/deps_scan.py's commit check — its own background process so
#                 `security_scan.run_scan()`'s tool call never delays a session start or a commit's
#                 own PreToolUse hook, mirroring "_update-check-worker".
#
#   "UserPromptSubmit --act-check": the prompt is not "/act"/"/act <name>", or it is a
#                 worker's own payload — exit 0, nothing on stdout (the common case, checked
#                 before any of manifest.py/tiers.py/checks.session is imported). On a match:
#                 one line on stdout, {"decision": "block", "reason": "<skill list or one skill's
#                 SKILL.md in full>"} — the format Claude Code is confirmed to read for
#                 UserPromptSubmit as "show `reason` to the user, never send this prompt to the
#                 model" (same mechanism the predecessor template used before the current `.act/`
#                 layout). Always exit 0 either way; a bug in .act/scripts/skills.py falls
#                 back to "say nothing, let the prompt through" rather than eating it.
#
# Exit-code contract for PreToolUse specifically: a mechanism error while checking a candidate
# write is NOT swallowed the way a SessionStart error is. Every other check in this template
# fails open (never blocks the session on its own bug); the write-guard is the one exception —
# "when in doubt, deny" — because a false allow here means the template
# silently loses its own files to an edit the next update overwrites anyway.
#
# Backward compatibility: every name that used to live directly in this module (before the
# checks/ split, 2026-09-23) is still reachable as dispatch.<name> — each checks/ submodule
# declares its public surface in its own __all__, and this file re-imports all of it with a
# wildcard import per submodule below. A probe that does `import dispatch; dispatch._foo(...)`
# keeps working unchanged; so does one that monkeypatches a name a check reads through another
# module's own attribute lookup at call time (e.g. checks.session._manifest_fingerprint reads
# manifest.manifest_fingerprint via getattr() on the shared `manifest` module on every call, not
# a copied reference — patching `manifest.manifest_fingerprint` from outside still takes effect
# no matter which file defines the function that reads it).

# call another, earlier check goes on to deny anyway (e.g. encoding_hint refusing a worker's Write to
# a non-UTF-8 file must not also count that call against the worker's cap). Every check ahead of them
# here — including deps_scan, which can also deny — runs first for the same reason; a future check
# that can deny stays ahead of these two unless it specifically needs to see their denial first.

    it through the way mcp_ide.py's own final `return 0` would for anything it does not classify
    (review finding 4b: a broken mcp_ide used to deny *every* `mcp__` call, even a plainly

    exists to guard against). A server with no IDE evidence at all (Gmail, Docs, ...) must stay
    untouched here exactly as it would with a working mcp_ide.

    Judged from checks.mcp_ide_tables -- the class tables mcp_ide.py itself reads, kept in a module
    of their own with nothing in it that can fail -- so a runtime error inside check_mcp_ide() and
    an import error of mcp_ide.py come out the same (the two used

    denies the orchestrator there, it only prints a note); a read tool never; an unlisted tool on an

    wildcard import above -- the one part of the definition that never depends on mcp_ide.py) for
    a worker only, as the working check would. Only if even the tables module cannot be used is

    Allowed call (denied=False): unchanged behavior, every observer in _OBSERVERS runs exactly as

    Denied call (denied=True): only checks.event_log.observe still runs (R-safe-block: every

    poll.observe/tips.observe only react to UserPromptSubmit anyway, so skipping them here changes

    Considered and rejected: passing `denied` as a third argument to every observer's own
