# Purpose: Check — a worker's tool calls beyond its assignment's cap (R-cost-delegate, PreToolUse).
#
# R-cost-delegate (.act/rules/orchestrator/30-cost.md) has the orchestrator name a `Cap: <n>` line
# in every assignment, mechanically checked the same way `Write scope:` is (checks/write_scope.py)
# — this module is that check. Without a `Cap:` line, the cap falls back to the default for the
# tier named in a `Tier: <tier>` line (`light` 10, `standard` 40, `elevated` 60, `high`/`expert`
# 80); with neither line, `standard` (40). See _parse_cap_and_tier.
#
# Binding a worker's tool call back to the cap its assignment named reuses the same mechanism as
# write_scope.py (see that module's docstring for the full rationale: meta.json's "toolUseId"
# first, the worker's own first transcript line as a fallback), but *not* write_scope's own
# functions — those parse and store its "scope" shape (mode/patterns), not a bare cap number, and
# this module must not edit write_scope.py (another builder's file) to add a generic variant. What
# *is* reused directly from write_scope.py (imported, not copied) is its lower-level, already-
# generic plumbing: `_read_json_object` (meta.json/state-file parsing), `_entry_is_fresh` (the
# same 24h freshness window `_SCOPE_ENTRY_TTL` already uses, reused here rather than redefining a
# second TTL constant), and `_SAFE_ID_RE` (the same "is this string a safe filename" check). The
# path-construction lines themselves (`<transcript>/subagents/agent-<id>.meta.json` /
# `.jsonl`) are the one piece genuinely duplicated from write_scope.py's _scope_via_meta /
# _scope_via_transcript — about ten lines of straightforward, unlikely-to-drift path arithmetic,
# not the check logic itself. See _meta_tool_use_id / _transcript_first_prompt.
#
# Storage lives in its own directory, `.act-local/worker-caps/` (not write_scope's
# `worker-scopes/`, per this check's own assignment): one file per Agent/Task start, keyed by
# `tool_use_id` (the cap that assignment names — _record_worker_cap/_resolve_worker_cap), and one
# file per running worker, keyed by `agent_id` (that worker's running tool-call count —
# _register_worker_call). Both kinds of file share the directory and the "*.json" prune glob
# (_prune_stale_entries), same as write_scope's single worker-scopes/ directory holds only one
# kind — nothing here assumes the two kinds cannot coexist since their filenames never collide
# (a raw tool_use_id vs. "count-" + agent_id).
#
# Two agent_ids never share a count file, so two parallel workers count separately by
# construction. A single agent_id's count file CAN see genuinely concurrent writers in a way
# write_scope's worker-scopes files do not (that module records/reads once per call; this one
# read-modifies-writes on every single worker tool call) — so, unlike write_scope's plain
# temp-file+os.replace, incrementing here is wrapped in a directory-based mutex (_locked): a
# same-named ".lock" directory, created via Path.mkdir(exist_ok=False), which is atomic on both
# POSIX and Windows and needs no third-party dependency. A lock that cannot be acquired within
# `_LOCK_TIMEOUT` is *not* treated as a permanent block on the worker's own tool call (fail open,
# same philosophy as every check here but write_guard) — the increment proceeds unlocked, meaning
# the cap arithmetic degrades to best-effort under that specific failure mode instead of ever
# stalling a worker over our own bookkeeping.
#
# Non-blocking hints (delivered at most once each per worker, see the config table's "a note at
# the cap"): researched against the Claude Code hook docs (code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks, fetched
# 2026-09-23) before writing this. Its `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` field is honored
# only for PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit and SessionStart — explicitly *not* for PreToolUse (the
# docs list a fixed field set for PreToolUse: permissionDecision, permissionDecisionReason,
# updatedInput, systemMessage, terminalSequence; permissionDecision "allow" ignores
# permissionDecisionReason and additionalContext both). More generally: a PreToolUse hook's
# *plain-text* stdout on exit 0 goes to the debug log only and is never added to Claude's context —
# this template's own PreToolUse `warn`-mode notes (write_guard, nesting_guard, write_scope) share
# that same known limitation. The only channel confirmed to reach Claude for PreToolUse is exit 2 +
# stderr (deny) — still used here, unchanged, for the 1.5x-the-cap denial in `block` mode.
#
# For the two non-blocking hints ("cap reached" and, in `warn` mode, "cap exceeded"), this module
# now (after PostToolUse was wired into dispatch.py) exports note_worker_cap(payload), registered
# in dispatch.py's _POST_TOOL_USE_NOTES and delivered via that event's own
# hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext — the field actually documented to reach the model. Division
# of labor: check_worker_cap (PreToolUse) is the only place that increments the running counter
# (_register_worker_call) and the only place that denies; it never prints a hint any more.
# note_worker_cap (PostToolUse) only *reads* the count check_worker_cap already wrote for this same
# tool call — it never increments a second time — and decides whether either hint is due, each
# delivered at most once per worker (`hinted_cap` / `hinted_exceeded` flags in the same count
# file). The "cap exceeded" hint only matters in `warn` mode: in `block` mode, a call at or past
# 1.5x the cap is denied by check_worker_cap before it ever runs, so PostToolUse never fires for it.
#
# Follow-up (2026-09-27): check_worker_cap used to increment the running
# counter (_register_worker_call) *before* deciding whether to deny — so the very call that first
# crossed 1.5x the cap, and every retried call after it, was counted as "used" even though it was
# refused, and kept the counter growing forever past the threshold on repeated retries. Smallest
# fix: _register_worker_call now takes an optional `deny_threshold` and, in the one mode
# (`block`) where a threshold applies, skips the write and reports the call as denied instead of
# incrementing — `warn` mode passes no threshold at all, so it keeps counting every call exactly
# as before (it never denies here in the first place). See _register_worker_call's own docstring.
#
# Follow-up review (2026-09-23, BLOCK on the version before this comment): `_CAP_LINE_RE` /
# `_TIER_LINE_RE` used to require `Cap:`/`Tier:` at the start of a line, missing the shape real
# assignment headers actually use ("Tier: standard · Estimate: ... · Cap: 95." — Tier at the
# start, Cap only after a "·"); `_KEY_BOUNDARY` now also matches right after "·", "|", ";" or ","
# anywhere in the line (see the comment above it for why a quoted "> Cap: 999" line still doesn't
# match either way). Also: `_locked`'s wait loop and `_prune_stale_entries` both now clear a lock
# directory older than `_LOCK_STALE_SECONDS` (`_clear_if_orphaned`) — previously an orphaned lock
# (holder crashed between mkdir and rmdir) cost every later caller the full `_LOCK_TIMEOUT` wait,
# forever, since nothing ever removed it.
