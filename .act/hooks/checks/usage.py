# Purpose: Observer for the template's local usage counter. This module only turns hook
#          events into tiny, one-shot event files — the schema, the consolidation step that folds
#          them into .act-local/usage.json, and the CLI (--show/--outcome/--unused/--reset) all
#          live in .act/scripts/usage.py; read that file's header first. Registered in
#          dispatch.py's _OBSERVERS as ("usage", "observe"): observe() runs for every hook event,
#          before any PreToolUse check, and must never raise or block (dispatch.py's
#          _run_observers already swallows an observer's exception, but this stays fast on its
#          own — writing one small file is O(1), no read-modify-write of shared state happens
#          here at all, see the concurrency note below).
#
# What is counted here, and from which event (dispatch.py's own docstring lists the wired events):
#   - a worker start, by role/tier/model: PreToolUse, tool_name "Agent"/"Task"
#     (checks.common._WORKER_TOOL_NAMES), *no* agent_id in the payload (the orchestrator's own
#     call, not a nested one — checks.common._is_worker), tool_input.subagent_type present.
#     Deliberately NOT keyed off SubagentStart's own agent_type instead: the brief line
#     "subagent_type from the orchestrator's Agent call, or agent_type at SubagentStart" offers
#     either signal for the same start, and only the PreToolUse call also carries the tier
#     ("Tier: ..." in tool_input.prompt) and the model (tool_input.model) that SubagentStart's own
#     payload does not — so using it alone avoids correlating two separate events (no queue, no
#     race between an Agent/Task call and its own SubagentStart, unlike checks/write_scope.py's
#     tool_use_id -> meta.json binding, which exists only because a *worker's own later* call has
#     no other way back to its assignment). This also gives "helper agents without agent_type
#     don't count" for free: an internal helper agent of the harness (empty agent_type, SubagentStop only, no
#     prior SubagentStart or Agent/Task call — confirmed in both 2026-09-23 live-probe captures,
#     see the brief) never reaches this branch at all, since it was never started through the
#     Agent/Task tool in the first place.
#   - a skill call: PreToolUse, tool_name "Skill", tool_input.skill.
#   - a slash command: UserPromptSubmit, payload.prompt starting with "/<name>" (the same field
#     .claude/scripts/ai-log.py's --hook mode reads for its own "[user] [prompt]" line).
#   - a script call: PreToolUse, tool_name "Bash"/"PowerShell" (checks.common._SHELL_TOOL_NAMES),
#     command containing ".act/scripts/<name>.py".
#   - a checklist read: PreToolUse, tool_name "Read", file_path under ".act/checklists/" or
#     "docs/ai/local/checklists/".
#   Cap hits and denials inside a PreToolUse *check* (worker-cap, status-poll, ...) cannot be seen
#   here — this observer runs before the checks (dispatch.py's fixed order). A check that wants
#   one counted calls usage.record(kind, key) itself instead — see that function's docstring in
#   .act/scripts/usage.py for the one line a check needs.
#   - SessionStart: no recording of its own — triggers usage.consolidate_at_session_start(), the
#     one place .act-local/usage/events/ actually shrinks again (2026-09-23 review, point 1: it
#     only ever grew otherwise). Budgeted, see that function's own docstring.
#
# Fixed (was "Known limit", 2026-09-23 review, point 4): this observer used to
# see a PreToolUse *before* any check ran (dispatch.py's own fixed order), so a role start, skill
# call, script call or checklist read was counted here even when a later check in the chain denied
# it (worker-cap, write-scope, nesting-guard, ...) — a denied attempt looked the same as a
# successful one in usage.json. dispatch.py now runs its PreToolUse observers *after* the checks
# (dispatch._run_pre_tool_use_observers) and skips this observer outright when the call was denied
# — this module's own observe() is therefore never called at all for a denied PreToolUse call any
# more, and every count below only ever reflects a call that actually ran. A check that wants its
# own denials counted (as opposed to simply not miscounting them here) still has usage.record() for
# that (see above) — the "checks" category, not "roles"/"skills"/..., is what holds rejection
# counts on purpose.
#
# Concurrency: many dispatch.py processes can run at once — parallel worker tool calls fire their
# own PreToolUse hooks concurrently (CLAUDE.md § Logging: only the Agent-call/SubagentStart/-Stop
# hooks are synchronous, all other events async). A shared counter in memory is not an
# option (separate processes), and a single shared JSON file updated read-modify-write per event
# would lose updates under that concurrency — the same failure mode checks/write_scope.py's own
# docstring documents for a single shared scope file (t26_race.py, 2026-09-23 review: 8 parallel
# writers, up to 6 of 8 lost under a naive single-file scheme). This module therefore never opens
# .act-local/usage.json itself — every call below goes through usage.record_event(), which gives
# each occurrence its own uniquely named file (mkstemp + os.replace, the same atomic-rename
# pattern write_scope.py uses for its per-worker scope files), so N parallel occurrences produce N
# files with no shared state to race over. Folding those files into the single usage.json is left
# to usage.py's own consolidation step, run by its CLI (--show/--outcome/--unused) — see that
# file's header for why concurrency is low there (normally only the orchestrator calls it).
