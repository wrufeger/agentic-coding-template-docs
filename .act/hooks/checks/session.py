# Purpose: SessionStart handling — inbox "answered, not yet processed" count (the single inbox at
#          docs/ai/inbox/, all kinds — question/todo/report/note),
#          bridge/role-frontmatter re-derivation, board refresh, sync of the files that
#          hang on a
#          docs/ai/config.md value — skill copies, CLAUDE.md and hook entries on `tools`, a role's
#          bridges on its "## Roles" row (tier/reasoning/model) — when one moved since the last
#          snapshot (see update.sync_dependent_files(), imported lazily at that one
#          call site so a session start
#          never pays for/depends on `update`'s own imports — entries, rules, ... — just for this
#          best-effort sub-step), template-awareness notes (check 2b), the active-topics
#          status line, the import check and, only as a fallback, a short form of the
#          orchestrator-only rules when docs/ai/rules.md does not import them (all gated by
#          their own docs/ai/config.md row, see _check_mode). refresh_session() is
#          the single SessionStart entry point dispatch.py calls; everything below feeds into it.
#          Unlike the PreToolUse checks, this is not a list of independent pass/fail gates — every
#          sub-step is its own best-effort note or side effect, and refresh_session() must never
#          fail the session over any of them.

    `git config` no checkout is guaranteed to have. A bridge whose hash no longer matches was
    edited locally and is left untouched either way.

    One exception: a root CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md that is not locally edited at all but a raw
    copy of the *template's own* bootstrap file (see `_is_bootstrap_copy`) never counts as "edited
    locally" — it never was the project's file to begin with, whatever its recorded hash says — so
    it is rewritten from the template source the same as an unchanged bridge, just reported
    separately (`bootstrapped`) rather than folded into `refreshed`.

    With `write=False` (check-mode-`warn`), nothing is written — the "refreshed"/"bootstrapped"
    lists report what would have changed instead.

    Returns (changed, refreshed, bootstrapped): `changed` are destinations left alone because

    `bootstrapped` are destinations re-derived because they turned out to be the template's own
    bootstrap file instead (or that would have been, under write=False).

    Each file is written and cached individually rather than batching the cache write
    until after the whole loop — a read/write failure partway through the map (a locked file, a
    permission error) used to leave every file processed *before* the failure both unrecorded in
    the cache and outside the caller's `touched` list (built from `refreshed`, since that append
    happened before the write was even attempted), so a bridge the update genuinely rewrote never
    made it into the commit and then looked "edited locally" at every later run because its
    recorded hash never caught up with what was actually on disk. Now a failure on one file only
