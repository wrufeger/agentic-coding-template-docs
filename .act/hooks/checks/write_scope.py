# Purpose: Check 1c — per-worker write scope (R-cost-delegate, PreToolUse).
#
# R-cost-delegate (.act/rules/orchestrator/30-cost.md) has the orchestrator name a `Write scope:`
# line in every assignment — one or more comma-separated glob patterns (project-root-relative,
# "/" as the separator; a bullet prefix and backticks around a pattern are both tolerated, see
# _parse_write_scope), or the literal `none` for a read-only assignment. Missing the line at all
# means "unrestricted" (no scope beyond the template's own .act/ write-guard, check 1) — a
# project that never writes the line never sees this check do anything beyond bookkeeping.
#
# Binding a worker's tool call back to the scope its assignment named runs through the harness's
# own bookkeeping (2026-09-23 live-probe, see the comment above _WORKER_TOOL_NAMES in
# checks/nesting_guard.py for the file): the orchestrator's PreToolUse for "Agent"/"Task" carries
# "tool_use_id" and "tool_input.prompt"; the harness then writes <transcript_path-without-
# ".jsonl">/subagents/agent-<agent_id>.meta.json for that spawned worker, whose "toolUseId" field
# is exactly that same tool_use_id, and agent-<agent_id>.jsonl, whose first line is the worker's
# own initial user message (message.content == the assignment prompt verbatim). So: record the
# scope parsed from the assignment prompt, in its own file keyed by tool_use_id (see
# _worker_scope_file — one file per id, not a shared JSON document, so N parallel Agent/Task
# starts never race each other into a lost update), when the orchestrator starts a worker; look
# it up again, keyed by agent_id -> meta.json -> toolUseId, when that worker later tries to write
# something. A second path (reading the assignment prompt straight out of the worker's own first
# transcript line) covers a missing/unreadable meta.json. If neither works, the binding is
# unresolved for *this* call — see _resolve_worker_scope and check_worker_write_scope's docstring
# for what happens then (it is fail-closed only when scoping is demonstrably in use nearby, not
# unconditionally).
