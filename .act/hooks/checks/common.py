# Purpose: Helpers shared by more than one check module under .act/hooks/checks/ — reading the
#          hook's JSON payload, resolving a check's on/off/warn mode from docs/ai/config.md, and
#          the two small lookup tables (which tool_input field holds a write target, which tool
#          names start a worker) more than one check needs. Anything used by exactly one check
#          stays in that check's own module instead of here.

# also queues/drains through these two, and encoding_hint.py's own key scheme for `path` (which
# id becomes the filename) changed independently of secret_scan.py's — keeping the read/write
# mechanics here, agnostic to what `path` means to any one caller, is what lets both keep using
