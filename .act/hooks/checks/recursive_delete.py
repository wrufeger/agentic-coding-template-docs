# Purpose: Check — a recursive delete run from the shell (PreToolUse, R-safe-no-shell-delete).
#          R-safe-no-shell-delete: "No `rm -rf` from the shell ...
#          clean up with the language's own means (`shutil.rmtree` in Python) or file by file."
#          For **everyone**, orchestrator included — a shell-level recursive delete is
#          the risk this check exists for regardless of who runs it. `python -c
#          "shutil.rmtree(...)"` is deliberately never matched: it is the recommended way and is
#          invisible to a shell-command scan by construction (the delete happens inside the
#          interpreter, not as a shell command word this check inspects).
#
#          Recognized as a single command: Bash `rm -r`/`-R`/`--recursive` (including a combined
#          cluster like `-rf`/`-fr`); the Windows cmd-style `rmdir /s`/`rd /s`/`del /s`/`erase /s`
#          (case-insensitive, any `/q` alongside does not matter); PowerShell `Remove-Item
#          -Recurse` and its aliases `rm`/`ri`/`del`/`rd`/`rmdir`/`erase` with `-Recurse` or an
#          unambiguous prefix of it (`-r`, `-rec`, ... — PowerShell's own parameter-name prefix
#          matching, not attempted for a flag glued to a value); `find ... -exec ... -delete`.
#          Recognized as a *pair*: a pipeline shaped like `Get-ChildItem ... -Recurse | <delete
#          command>` (also via its aliases `gci`/`dir`/`ls`) — neither half looks recursive on its
#          own (a plain `Remove-Item` without `-Recurse` only removes what the pipe hands it, but
#          the pipe itself hands it an entire recursive listing), so this is checked as an
#          adjacency, not a per-command flag (see _is_recursive_listing/_is_delete_sink and the
#          pairwise scan in check_recursive_delete). A plain `rmdir`/`rd`/`del`/`erase` with no
#          recursion marker (removes only an already-empty directory / one named file) is not
#          flagged.
#
#          Command decomposition (finding every simple command despite quoting, heredocs, `bash
#          -c`/`pwsh -c`/`cmd /c`/`eval`/`$(...)`/backticks/`find -exec`/`xargs`) is
#          checks/command_words.py's job, shared with checks/worker_git_write.py and
#          checks/commit_pathspec.py — see that module's own header for why the first version of
#          this stage's segmenting (a bare operator-character regex split) was wrong and got
#          replaced (review, 2026-09-23); this check is also the one that needs
#          _command_word_lists' separator information directly, for the pipeline pattern above.
#
# Known limits:
#   - `-r`/`-rec`/... as a PowerShell `-Recurse` abbreviation is matched only when it stands as
#     its own token (an unquoted, space-separated argument); `-Recurse:$true` or a value glued
#     directly onto the flag is not specifically parsed (would still match as a "recurse"-prefix
#     token as long as the glued remainder does not turn it into something that no longer starts
#     with a `-recurse` prefix, e.g. `-Recurse:$true` still matches; `-RecurseFoo` would not,
#     since "recurse" is not a prefix of "recursefoo" the other way around — the match direction
#     is deliberately "does 'recurse' start with this flag's own letters", not the reverse).
#   - the pipeline pattern only looks at the ONE command immediately before a `|` — a longer chain
#     (`Get-ChildItem ... -Recurse | Where-Object {...} | Remove-Item`) is not connected across the
#     filter stage; accepted as a known gap rather than modeling arbitrary pipeline depth for a
#     pattern this narrow.
#   - segmenting/tokenizing otherwise shares checks/command_words.py's known limits (best-effort
#     PowerShell quoting, bounded recursion depth, a recursed sub-command's separators starting
#     fresh — see that module's header).
#   - a delete run from inside a program, a script file, or `xargs` fed from stdin with no command
#     of its own visible on the line, is invisible — matches shell_targets.py's own stated limits
#     for the same class of gap.
