# Purpose: PowerShell write-target scanner — the PowerShell counterpart of shell_targets.py, for
#          the same two callers (checks/write_guard.py check 1, checks/write_scope.py check 1c).
#          Claude Code on Windows offers a `PowerShell` tool next to `Bash` (tool_input.command,
#          seen in a live probe); both checks used to look at Bash only. This module
#          answers the same question shell_targets.py answers for Bash — which paths does a
#          command
#          write to — but for PowerShell syntax, and with a deliberately different return shape:
#
#          _powershell_write_targets(command, base_cwd, git_writes, broad=False, depth=0)
#              -> set[str] | None
#
#          Bash's _bash_write_targets returns (raw, base) pairs because a Bash command can leave
#          several *possible* current directories active at the same point (an `||` list, a `cd`
#          inside a subshell) — resolution is deferred to the caller. A PowerShell script runs one
#          statement after another with exactly one current directory at any point, so this module
#          tracks it itself (Set-Location/cd/Push-Location) and resolves every target it can to an
#          absolute, forward-slash path before returning it; a target it cannot resolve (still
#          carries a variable/sub-expression, or its base directory turned unknown after an
#          unresolvable Set-Location) is returned as its own literal text instead — a caller can
#          tell the two apart with shell_targets._is_absolute_target/_is_dynamic_target exactly the
#          way it already does for a Bash target whose base came back None. Returns None instead of
#          a (possibly empty) set when the command as a whole is not safely evaluable this way
#          (Invoke-Expression/iex, an unterminated quote or here-string) — checks/write_guard.py
#          (check 1, "when in doubt, deny") then denies if _PROTECTED_PATH_RE matches anywhere in
#          the raw command text; checks/write_scope.py (check 1c) falls back to
#          _ps_raw_redirect_targets, the same operator-based fallback Bash's own scanner uses.
#
#          `broad` (2026-09-23 review, BLOCK) is check 1's own extra, deliberately over-inclusive
#          pass (see _broad_guard_candidates): every positional and every flag value — recognized
#          or not — of a call to a recognized write cmdlet, every word of a `$var = ...`
#          assignment's right-hand side, and every word of a statement using the call operator `&`
#          or a script block `{ ... }`, added as raw (unresolved) text candidates alongside the
#          precise ones. check 1c passes broad=False (the default) and stays exact — a worker's
#          write scope is enforced against the one real target, not against everything a command
#          merely mentions. `depth` caps pwsh/powershell -c/-Command recursion (see
#          _PS_INTERP_NAMES) the same way shell_targets._MAX_SCAN_DEPTH caps Bash's own recursion.
#
# Recognized as a write (see _ALIASES/_CD_ALIASES/_FLAG_ONLY_KEYS and _flush_ps_statement for the
# exact mapping):
#   - redirections `>`, `>>`, `*>`, `2>` (also `*>>`/`2>>`/`3>`.../a glued fd digit, harmless
#     extras) — but not a target that is itself just a stream duplication/null device, see
#     _ps_is_ignorable (`2>&1`, `2>$null`, `*> $null`, `> NUL`, `> nul:`);
#   - Set-Content/sc, Add-Content/ac, Clear-Content/clc, Set-Item/si, Rename-Item/ren/rni,
#     Export-Csv, Export-Clixml (-Path/-LiteralPath or 1st positional);
#   - Out-File, Tee-Object (-FilePath/-Path or 1st positional);
#   - New-Item/ni/mkdir/md (-Path and/or -Name, joined; 1st positional is -Path);
#   - Copy-Item/cp/copy/cpi, Move-Item/mv/move/mi (-Destination, or the 2nd positional — the 1st is
#     the source, never itself a target, unless -Path named the source explicitly, in which case
#     the sole remaining positional is the destination);
#   - Remove-Item/rm/del/ri/rd/rmdir/erase (every -Path/-LiteralPath value plus every positional);
#   - Expand-Archive (-DestinationPath); Invoke-WebRequest/iwr (-OutFile);
#   - [System.IO.File]/[IO.File]/[global::System.IO.File]::WriteAllText/WriteAllLines/
#     AppendAllText/AppendAllLines/WriteAllBytes/Copy/Move/Create(...) (1st argument), and
#     [...IO.StreamWriter]::new(...) (1st argument) — matched against the statement's words
#     rejoined with a single space each, so whitespace right after the opening "(" does not split
#     the match across two words;
#   - `git mv|rm|checkout|restore` (git_writes chooses which, same split as shell_targets.py: check
#     1 only mv/rm, check 1c also checkout/restore), via shell_targets._git_targets, reused as-is;
#   - `bash -c "..."` / `sh -c "..."`, scanned with shell_targets._bash_write_targets (the Bash
#     scanner); `cmd`/`cmd.exe /c "..."`, scanned the same way (an approximation — cmd.exe's own
#     redirect syntax is close enough to Bash's for `>`/`>>`/`2>`, not identical);
#   - `pwsh`/`powershell`(.exe) `-c`/`-Command "..."`, scanned recursively with *this* module
#     (still PowerShell syntax), up to _PS_MAX_SCAN_DEPTH deep;
#   - Set-Location/cd/sl/Push-Location updates the tracked current directory for what follows;
#     an unresolvable target (a variable, or nothing findable) makes it unknown from there on.
#   - check 1 only (`broad=True`, see _broad_guard_candidates): additionally, every word of a
#     Start-Process/Invoke-Command/python(3)/py invocation (their own write behaviour is opaque —
#     this is a literal-text net, not a resolved target), every word after `& $sb`/`& { ... }`
#     appearing anywhere in a statement, and every word to the right of `$var =`.
#
# Statement separators: `;`, `|`, a bare newline, `&&`/`||` (PS 7) — see _PS_SEPARATOR_OPS.
# Quoting: '...' verbatim except '' -> a literal '; "..." with a backtick as the escape character
# and "" -> a literal " (both PowerShell rules); a backtick followed by a newline is a line
# continuation (dropped, not a separator); an unquoted "#" starts a comment to the end of the
# line (PowerShell has no Bash-style "start of word" restriction on it); @'...'@ / @"..."@
# here-strings become a single opaque word each — their content is never scanned as commands or
# redirections and never enters a `broad` candidate either (see _is_here_string_word), which is
# also why `> .act/x` written *inside* a here-string body is not read as a redirection or a write.
#
# Known limits (a target missed here is simply not checked — see the two _ALIASES gaps noted
# above for Copy-Item/Move-Item in mixed positional/named form, beyond the one `-Path`-as-source
# shape this module does understand):
#   - Invoke-Expression/iex anywhere in the command makes the whole command bail to None — what it
#     runs is opaque to a syntactic scan, but check 1 still denies if the raw command text mentions
#     .act/ anywhere (see this module's docstring and checks/write_guard.py);
#   - a target built from a variable ($var, $env:X) or a sub-expression ($(...)) is never resolved
#     — kept as its own literal text, denied only if that text itself names .act/ (check 1) or is
#     out of scope by definition (check 1c, same as an unresolved Bash target); a Join-Path/other
#     expression call is not evaluated either, only caught (check 1 only) via `broad`'s literal-text
#     net over the call's own positionals/flag values, or its assignment's right-hand side;
#   - a comma-separated array argument (`-Path a,b`) is read as one glued word, not two targets;
#   - an abbreviated/partial parameter name (`-Fi` for `-FilePath`) is not matched to its flag —
#     it is dropped as an unrecognized switch, which usually still leaves its value as a stray
#     positional (recovered by the cmdlet's own positional fallback) rather than lost outright;
#   - only the literal fd number "2" is gated like Bash's fd-glue special case (`file2>x` stays one
#     word) for the length-3/gated length-2 operators; another digit glued the same way (`file3>x`)
#     is read as a generic `>` at that position — `3>` on its own (nothing accumulated yet) is still
#     recognized as a redirection, just via the ungated ">" match, same end result.
