# Purpose: Check — secret scan before a commit (PreToolUse, `R-safe-no-secret-diff`). Triggers on
#          a Bash/PowerShell call that runs `git commit` (also inside a chain, with global options
#          like `git -C x commit`, a nested shell, or a simple git alias) — for orchestrator and
#          worker alike (decided: the dispatcher is the only gate, no separate git hook). What gets
#          checked is exactly what the commit would take:
#            - `git diff --cached -U0` (always) -- every git call of the walk runs from the
#              repository's top level, not the commit's own directory: with `diff.relative=true` a
#              diff from a subdirectory silently drops everything outside it (2026-09-27 review 3,
#              m3; the pathspecs handed in are absolute or top-anchored, so nothing else changes);
#            - with `-a`/`--all`, or an earlier `git add -u|--update|-A|--all|--no-ignore-removal`
#              *without a pathspec* (or `git add` with no paths at all, or `git add :/`) in the
#              same chain, also `git diff -U0` (unstaged changes to every tracked file, not just the
#              ones named) -- with a pathspec (`git add -A src`) git stages only under it, so only
#              the per-path walk below runs for it (review 3, M1);
#            - after an earlier `git add -A|--all|--no-ignore-removal` without a pathspec (or
#              `--pathspec-from-file`, or `git add :/`) in the same chain, also every new, untracked
#              file in the whole working tree (git's own `:/` pathspec, _WHOLE_TREE_PATHSPEC -- from
#              a subdirectory too, where a bare `git ls-files` stops at the current directory;
#              2026-09-27 review 2, C2); new files are read via the repository's top level
#              (`--full-name`), so a name in a finding is root-relative whichever directory the
#              commit runs from. A short flag counts inside a cluster too (`-fA`, `-Av`; review 3,
#              m2), and `git stage` is read as `git add`;
#            - `git commit <pathspec>`'s own trailing pathspec operands (message/author/etc.
#              options and their values excluded — see _COMMIT_VALUE_FLAGS), and any `git add
#              <paths>` earlier in the same chain (not staged yet when this PreToolUse call
#              happens — nothing in the chain has run yet): for each, `git diff -U0 -- <path>`
#              plus the content of any new, untracked file under it (`git ls-files --others`,
#              *without* `--exclude-standard` when that `add` used `-f`/`--force` — a forced add
#              can stage a gitignored file, e.g. `.env`, that `--exclude-standard` would otherwise
#              hide from view here too); a top-anchored magic pathspec (`:/src`, `:(top)src`) is
#              handed to git as written, every other operand resolved to an absolute path first;
#            - `git merge|cherry-pick|revert|rebase|am --continue` — only the staged diff (these
#              commit whatever is already staged, no working-tree pass).
#          A `bash -c '...'`/`sh -c '...'`, `powershell`/`pwsh -Command '...'`, or `cmd /c ...`
#          nested inside the chain is unwrapped and scanned the same way, recursively, up to
#          _MAX_NESTED_DEPTH. A subcommand that is not literally one of the above is looked up as a
#          simple git alias (`git config --get alias.<name>`, cached per call) once time remains in
#          the shared budget.
#
#          Only added lines ('+') count — a removed secret does not hold up the commit. Matched
#          against: known key/token formats (AWS, GitHub, GitLab, Slack, Stripe, Google, OpenAI/
#          Anthropic, JWT, a private-key block), a newly added file named `.env`/`.env.*` (the
#          `.env.example`/`.env.sample`/`.env.template` trio excepted), and a `KEY = "value"`-style
#          assignment (JSON-style `"key": "value"` too — every such candidate on a line is tried,
#          not just the first) whose key looks credential-related (feedback_privacy.SECRET_WORDS,
#          reused rather than a second word list) and whose value is at least 20 characters with
#          Shannon entropy at or above 3.0 bit/char for a purely hex-digit value, 3.5 otherwise (the
#          key-name gate already keeps ordinary code/prose out, so the bar itself can sit lower). A
#          line containing the marker `act:allow-secret`, or a value that reads as a placeholder
#          (`<token>`, `${VAR}`, `xxx...`, `changeme`, `example`, ...), is never reported.
#          An *unquoted* value that is code rather than a literal is never measured, but only in a
#          source-code file (_SOURCE_EXTENSIONS: .py .js .ts .vue .php .java .go .cs ... ; the path
#          comes from the diff section / new-file name), never on a comment line (leading `#`,
#          `//`, `/*`, `*`, `--`, `<!--`) or after a comment marker earlier on the line, and never
#          for a value that looks generated (two or more separate digit runs, `Ab3dEf9Gh...`):
#          a call (identifier or member path directly followed by `(` -- a keyword argument whose
#          value is a function call), a member-access path (a field copied from a request body,
#          `req.body.<field>`) or a plain identifier. In every other file
#          (`.env*`, .ini, .cfg, .conf, .properties, .yaml/.yml, .toml, shell scripts, Dockerfile,
#          docs, no or unknown extension) a bare value is a literal and stays measured, whatever
#          its shape. A quoted value is always measured.
#          All findings are named in the hold message, up to _MAX_FINDINGS one by one, then "+N more"
#          with the total and the affected files, so one round of marking is enough;
#          the scan itself stops collecting at _MAX_COLLECTED.
#          Deliberately not flagged, by construction rather than as a special case: a lockfile's
#          `"integrity": "sha512-..."`/`"resolved": "..."` or a bare UUID never matches the
#          assignment rule, because their key names are not in the credential vocabulary.
#
#          Chain parsing reuses shell_targets' tokenizer (_line_mode_tokens/_shell_tokens — quoting
#          and heredocs handled the same way as check 1/1c) rather than a second shlex-based
#          scanner; on top of the token stream this module only needs "which simple commands appear
#          in this order" (_simple_commands) and "is this one a `git <sub>` call, and under which
#          `-C` directory" (_git_call) — much less than shell_targets' write-target machinery, so
#          it is its own small walker, not a copy of _scan_tokens. If the command cannot be
#          tokenized at all (an unclosed quote, `$'...'` ANSI-C quoting — that tokenizer does not know it),
#          a coarse raw-text fallback treats a bare "git ... commit" mention as a `-a`-style commit
#          with no known add-paths — over-inclusive on purpose, the same stance shell_targets takes
#          for its own tokenizing fallback. The chain is read twice — once with the previous
#          tokenizer (shell_targets_legacy, no backtick spans) and once with the word lexer — and
#          the commits of both readings are scanned (_git_commit_invocations): the lexer can add a
#          commit to scan, never drop one the previous reading had, and a failure in its reading
#          leaves the previous one standing.
#
#          A file's own diff section over 2MB is skipped (named in the "not fully checked" note),
#          every other file in the same diff is still scanned — the 2MB line is per file, not per
#          diff. Diff/ls-files calls run with `-c core.quotePath=false` (readable non-ASCII names
#          instead of octal escapes) and, for diff, `--no-textconv` (do not run a configured
#          textconv filter — closer to what is actually being committed).
#
#          Timeout-aware: a fixed ~4.5s budget shared across every git subprocess call (including
#          alias lookups) and file read for this check, capped further by the hook-wide deadline
#          (_check_deadline: dispatch.py's own start, payload["_act_hook_started"], plus
#          _HOOK_BUDGET -- inside the harness's 10s hook timeout; the secret, danger and deps scans
#          run back to back in one hook call, so their budgets must not simply add up, 2026-09-27
#          review 2, m5). Running out
#          of it never blocks by itself — only a note ("not fully checked") — but real findings
#          from the part that *was* scanned still hold the commit. The note says which limit hit
#          (_incomplete_note): the time budget (or a failed git call), and/or the files skipped for
#          size, named.
#
#          PreToolUse's plain stdout (the `warn`-mode hold message, the "not fully checked" note)
#          is transcript-only and never reaches the model on an allowed (exit 0) call — confirmed
#          against the harness docs, see checks/encoding_hint.py's header for the research this
#          module leans on rather than repeating. note_secret_scan() is the PostToolUse companion:
#          it drains and returns whatever check_secret_scan queued for this session (reusing
#          encoding_hint's generic queue helpers, `.act-local/secret-scan-notes/<session>.
#          pending.json` of its own), once, via hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext — the field
#          actually documented to reach the model for that event. Registration is dispatch.py's own
#          (out of this module's write scope): add `("secret_scan", "note_secret_scan"),` to
#          `_POST_TOOL_USE_NOTES` (dispatch.py:193, right after the `("encoding_hint", ...)` line).
#
# Known limits:
#   - a target reached only through `python -c`, a script, `eval`, `$(...)`, or a shell function is
#     invisible, same as shell_targets' own write-target scan;
#   - `cd`/`-C` tracking is a single "current directory", not shell_targets' branch-aware set of
#     possible directories, and only a literal `cd <dir>`/`git -C <dir>` moves it — `pushd`/
#     PowerShell's `Set-Location` do not, so a chain using either can end up scanned against the
#     wrong directory (a wrong guess only weakens the scan, never blocks something real);
#   - a word right after a redirection operator (`git commit -m x > log.txt`) is not specially
#     dropped, so it can end up as an extra, harmless word in that command's argument list;
#   - the tokenizer is POSIX/Bash-shaped; a PowerShell/cmd-specific construct (backtick escaping, a
#     cmdlet, `$(...)`) is only approximated, not specially understood — nested-shell unwrapping
#     (`_nested_command`) covers the common `-c`/`-Command`/`/c` shape only;
#   - alias resolution follows exactly one level, ignores a shell alias (`alias.x = !...`), and
#     substitutes only the resolved subcommand name — an alias's own default arguments (e.g.
#     `alias.ci = commit -v`) are not merged in, only whatever the caller wrote after the alias;
#   - a value under 20 characters is never checked at all (the length floor that keeps the
#     entropy/keyword heuristic's false-positive rate down);
#   - a file under a `-diff` gitattribute is invisible to `git diff` regardless of `--no-textconv`
#     (an unrelated feature — `-diff` makes git treat the file as binary outright) — accepted gap,
#     not worked around here (2026-09-23 review);
#   - `--pathspec-from-file` (on `add` or `commit`) is treated as "scan everything", the same as
#     `-a`/`-A` — its file is not read to recover the actual path list;
#   - a pathspec whose magic is relative to the directory git runs in (`:(glob)*.txt`, `:!secrets`,
#     `:(icase)x`) is not understood: it is resolved like a plain file name and matches nothing, and
#     an exclude in it is not applied to the other operands (a file it excludes is still scanned --
#     over-inclusive, never a miss elsewhere); only a top-anchored one (`:/x`, `:(top)x`) is handed
#     to git as written (2026-09-27 review 3);
#   - a `git add -u|-A "$dir"` whose operand cannot be placed keeps the flag's widest reading (the
#     whole tree), over-inclusive on purpose -- a plain `git add "$dir"` stays invisible, as above.
