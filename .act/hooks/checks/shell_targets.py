# Purpose: Bash write-target scanner — shared by checks/write_guard.py (check 1) and
#          checks/write_scope.py (check 1c). Both need the same answer for a Bash command: which
#          paths does it write to, and against which directory is a relative one resolved. Two
#          earlier versions answered that with regexes over the raw text and failed review both
#          times (2026-09-23): the first read a `>` inside quotes or a heredoc body as a
#          redirection, the second masked quotes and heredocs by regex and thereby hid real
#          redirections (`echo \" > f \"`, `echo don\'t > f`, a quoted "<<EOF", ...). This version
#          tokenizes instead — shlex in POSIX mode with the operator characters as their own
#          tokens — so quoting and escaping are decided by one tokenizer, and operators are read
#          from the token stream, never from raw text. Steps (_scan_command):
#   1. backslash-newline continuations are joined (_LINE_CONTINUATION_RE);
#   2. line mode: every line is tokenized on its own; a line whose token stream carries a real
#      `<<`/`<<-` operator plus delimiter has the heredoc body skipped up to its terminator line —
#      several heredocs on one line in turn, and nothing at all if a terminator line is missing
#      (_line_mode_tokens); the `$(...)`/backtick parts of an unquoted-delimiter body, which bash
#      does run, are kept as commands of their own;
#   3. conservative fallback when a line does not tokenize on its own (an unclosed quote, typically
#      a string spanning lines) or the command uses ANSI-C quoting `$'...'`, which shlex does not
#      know: the whole command is tokenized in one go (newline as an operator, a multi-line string
#      becomes one token, no heredoc skipping); if that fails too, or for `$'...'` in any case,
#      every word after a `>`-style operator in the raw text also counts as a target
#      (_raw_redirect_targets) — over-blocking is the accepted price there;
#   4. the token stream is walked command by command (_scan_tokens): redirections, the write
#      commands of _simple_command_targets, `cd` for the base directory, and the contents of
#      `sh -c "..."`, `eval`, `$(...)` and backticks scanned recursively.
#
# Known limits (a target missed here is simply not checked — resolved toward over-blocking wherever
# the command itself is ambiguous):
#   - writes made from inside a program are invisible: `python -c "open(...)"`, a script file,
#     `find -exec`, `xargs` fed from stdin, an alias or shell function;
#   - a target containing a variable, a command substitution, a brace expansion or a leading `~` is
#     never resolved (_is_dynamic_target): check 1c denies it, check 1 passes it unless its text
#     names .act/;
#   - an fd number glued to a redirection (`2>`) cannot be told apart from a separate word (`echo
#     2 > f`) once tokenized, so a bare number right before a redirection is dropped as fd;
#   - only the directory changes listed in _scan_tokens are followed; anything else there makes
#     the base unknown rather than guessed;
#   - not recognized as writers at all: `patch`, a `tar`/`unzip` extraction into the
#     implicit current directory (no explicit `-C`/`-d`), `find -delete` with no leading path
#     operand, `git apply`/`stash`/`reset --hard`/`clean`. `tar -x -C <dir>`, `unzip -d <dir>` and
#     `find <path> ... -delete` *are* recognized (see _simple_command_targets) since their target
#     is then determinable the same cheap way `cd`/`-C` already is; the rest is genuinely open-
#     ended (`patch`'s target is named inside the diff text itself, `git apply`'s likewise) and
#     is only ever caught by the raw-redirect fallback if it happens to also redirect;
#   - `git checkout <ref> -- .act/x` (or `git restore --source=<ref> -- .act/x`) is recognized as a
#     write to `.act/x` (both are in _GIT_WRITES_WORKER_SCOPE, and check 1's own
#     _GIT_WRITES_TEMPLATE_GUARD leaves them out on purpose so the orchestrator can restore a
#     template file this way) but not as what it actually does: replace `.act/x` with whatever
#     content `<ref>` happens to hold, including content a worker itself committed earlier in the
#     same session — a restore, not a rewrite from scratch. Accepted as a residual risk of trusting
#     the orchestrator's own git history rather than a gap in target detection;
#   - a line opening a heredoc (`<<`/`<<-`) that also contains `[`, `${`, `$[` or a backtick opens
#     no heredoc at all here (_NO_HEREDOC_MARKERS, since 2026-09-23) — safe on the side that matters
#     (a real heredoc body is never mistakenly skipped as something else), but its actual body lines
#     are then scanned as ordinary commands instead of being skipped, which can raise a spurious
#     target from body text that was never going to run as a command (over-scanning, not a missed
#     write);
#   - backticks are found by a regex over the already dequoted words (_scan_tokens,
#     _BACKTICK_SPAN_RE), with no quote context left by then (open: a pre-tokenizing mask
#     of every span was tried on 2026-09-25 and taken out again the same day after failing review
#     twice — it lost `command_words.py`'s recursion, then mistook an apostrophe inside double
#     quotes for a single quote, opening more bypasses than it closed). Three consequences: a span
#     whose own text opens a quote leaks that quote into the rest of the command
#     (`` echo `echo '` > other/f `echo '` `` — bash runs the `>`, this scanner reads it as quoted
#     text: a known bypass); a backtick pair inside a single-quoted string (a commit message
#     `git commit -m 'note `rm x`'`) is still recursed into as if bash ran it (a false block when
#     that text names a protected path or a blocked command); and an unquoted span containing
#     whitespace is split into several words, so a redirection target or operand that starts one is
#     seen only as its first fragment (`echo x > \`echo .act/x\`` yields the target "`echo" — dynamic,
#     so check 1c denies it, but a caller's text-only fallback such as check 1's finds no `.act/`
#     in it; the span's own content is still scanned for writes of its own).
