# Purpose: Check 1 — template write-guard (PreToolUse), checked before every other check. Denies
#          an AI write under .act/**, pointing at docs/ai/local/<path> instead.
#
# Exit-code contract specific to this check: a mechanism error while checking a candidate write is
# NOT swallowed the way most other checks fail open. Every other check in this template fails open
# (never blocks the session on its own bug); this one is the exception — "when in doubt, deny"
# — because a false allow here means the template silently loses its own
# files to an edit the next update overwrites anyway.
