# Purpose: Security check Art B: a live library-vulnerability lookup against the lock
#          files an ecosystem actually has, run either as a manual command (`--deps`) or from
#          `checks/deps_scan.py` before a commit and `checks/session.py` once a day (both reuse
#          `run_scan`/`available_tools` from here rather than shelling out a second time). Art A
#          (dangerous patterns) is `checks/danger_scan.py`; Art C (Semgrep, `act-release`) is
#          `security_deep.py`, a separate script.
#
#          One tool for everything, chosen once per call to `run_scan` (never mixed within one
#          run): `osv-scanner` first -- one database (OSV/GHSA and friends) covering every
#          ecosystem this module detects a lock file for, so it is preferred whenever installed
#          even if an ecosystem-specific tool is *also* installed. Without it, one tool per
#          ecosystem instead, each independent (a missing/broken tool in one ecosystem never hides
#          a finding in another): `npm audit --json` (npm's own `package-lock.json`), `composer
#          audit --format=json` (`composer.lock`), `pip-audit --disable-pip --no-deps -r
#          <requirements.txt>` (a *pinned* requirements file only -- see "pip-audit mode" below).
#          `yarn.lock`/`pnpm-lock.yaml`/`go.mod`/`Cargo.lock` have no ecosystem-specific fallback
#          coded here at all; without `osv-scanner` they are named in `missing_tools` and simply
#          not scanned, same as `poetry.lock`/`Pipfile.lock` (pip-audit's own `--no-deps` mode only
#          takes a plain requirements file, not a lock format of its own).
#
#          osv-scanner CLI form (2026-09-27 review): osv-scanner not installed on this machine —
#          the two invocation shapes below are read off the tool's own documentation, not verified
#          against a real run, and are stated here as an assumption rather than a confirmed fact.
#          v1 takes `-L <lockfile>` directly after `--format json`; v2 moved every scan mode under
#          a `scan` subcommand (`osv-scanner scan source --lockfile=<path> ...`). `_run_osv_scanner`
#          tries the v1 shape first (the common case today) and falls back to the v2 shape only
#          when the first attempt's own stderr looks like a "no such flag"/usage complaint rather
#          than a real scan failure — see `_looks_like_cli_mismatch`.
#
#          pip-audit mode: `--disable-pip --no-deps -r <file>` reads the pinned versions straight
#          out of the file and looks each one up against its own vulnerability database -- it never
#          installs a package, builds one, or executes anything from the project (`--disable-pip`
#          drops pip-audit's own default "resolve missing pins by installing them" behaviour,
#          `--no-deps` keeps it from walking a package's own dependency tree either). A
#          requirements file with an unpinned line (`requests` with no `==`) is passed through
#          unchanged -- pip-audit itself decides what it can and cannot look up from that, this
#          module does not pre-filter it.
#
#          `available_tools()` is the one place that decides what is actually installed --
#          `checks/deps_scan.py`, `checks/session.py`'s daily note, and `.act/scripts/init.py`'s
#          setup-time offer (`security-check: deps` when a tool exists) all call this instead of
#          probing `shutil.which` themselves, so a fourth caller never drifts from what this module
#          already knows how to run.
#
#          Scan cache (`.act-local/security-scan-cache/`, section "Scan cache" below): the commit
#          check never runs a tool inside its own hook call; it asks checks/session.py's detached
#          "_security-scan-worker" to scan exactly the lock files the commit touches and reads the
#          answer back from `<state-hash>.json` here -- `state-hash` = `lock_set_digest()` over
#          those files' paths and contents, so a result only ever answers for the very content it
#          scanned (the worker digests before and after its run and writes nothing when the two
#          differ). `<state-hash>.running.json` marks a scan in flight, with a `stale_after`
#          derived from the tools' own timeouts (`scan_time_limit()`), never a fixed guess. Both
#          the check (`checks/deps_scan.py`) and the worker (`checks/session.py`) go through the
#          helpers here rather than spelling the file names out twice.
#
#          Accepted exceptions: `docs/ai/local/security-accepted.md`, one line per advisory id --
#          `- <advisory-id>: <reason>` (a Markdown list item, the same shape every other project
#          doc uses for a list; `#`-comments and blank lines ignored). `load_accepted()` never
#          raises on a missing or malformed file -- an empty result there just means nothing is
#          accepted yet, not an error.
#
# Known limits:
#   - severity is read as each tool already reports it (`database_specific.severity` for
#     osv-scanner, falling back to its own `groups[].max_severity` CVSS score when that is absent —
#     see `_osv_group_severity`/`_severity_from_cvss`: >=9 critical, >=7 high, >=4 moderate, else
#     low — and `severity` for npm/composer) and only normalized to
#     critical/high/moderate/low/unknown -- a raw CVSS *vector string* (osv-scanner's own
#     `severity[].score` field, as opposed to the numeric `groups[].max_severity`) is not parsed
#     into a numeric score here;
#   - pip-audit's default JSON output carries no severity field at all -- every pip-audit finding
#     is "unknown" severity, never "high"/"critical", until pip-audit itself starts reporting one.
#     This means a pip-audit finding can never hold a commit on its own (only `deps_scan.py`'s own
#     high/critical check does that, and "unknown" never qualifies) -- it only ever notes;
#   - `composer audit` names no fixed version in its own JSON output -- `fixed_version` is always
#     None for a composer finding;
#   - `detect_lock_files` walks the whole project tree (skipping `.git`, `.act`, `node_modules`,
#     `vendor`, `.venv`/`venv`, `__pycache__`, `dist`, `build`, and any dot-directory) -- a lock
#     file placed somewhere else this list does not skip is still found, one placed *inside* one of
#     these directories on purpose (an unusual layout) is not;
#   - every tool call is a real subprocess with argument lists, never a shell string -- a tool that
#     needs network access (osv-scanner's own database lookup, if not run with a local database)
#     reaches it itself; this module never opens a connection of its own.
