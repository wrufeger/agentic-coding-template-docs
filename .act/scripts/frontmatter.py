#
# Purpose: One shared frontmatter parser for every "---\n...\n---\n" block under .act/ and
#          docs/ai/local/ -- used to be two: tiers.py's split_frontmatter() (single-line fields
#          only, built for the template's own generated bridge files) and settings_load.py's
#          _strict_frontmatter() (a hand-rolled parser gating an import's risky-key/name checks).
#          Two parsers meant two places that could each be wrong about the same shape (found
#          in review) -- this module reads a BOM, CRLF, single/double-quoted values, and a
#          multi-line value (a ">"/"|" block scalar or a plain indented continuation), which is the
#          shape Claude Code frontmatter actually uses (see .act/agents/*.md, .act/skills/*/SKILL.md
#          and the generated .act/bridges/agents/*.md -- none of the template's own files need the
#          multi-line/quoted forms today, but a project's own hand-authored role or skill can).
#
# Usage: not run directly -- imported (`import frontmatter`) from a script in .act/scripts/ or
#        .act/hooks/ (both add their own directory to sys.path automatically).
#
# Output format: no CLI output of its own; parse_frontmatter()'s return value is documented below.
#        A caller that must stay lenient on a malformed block (tiers.py: never abort a session
#        start over a bad file) uses ok=False as "nothing to resolve here", exactly like the
#        no-frontmatter-at-all case -- the parser itself never raises. A caller that must reject a
#        malformed block (settings_load.py: refuse importing a unit it cannot read with confidence)
#        uses ok=False as its refusal signal, with `error` (line number + offending text) folded
#        into the message it reports.
