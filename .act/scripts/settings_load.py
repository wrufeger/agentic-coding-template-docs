#
# Purpose: `act-load-settings` — import a portable settings file (or several) into this project:
#          the counterpart to settings_export.py. Runs the same three-way check the reconcile skill
#          runs after a template update, except the "other side" is
#          a settings file instead of a new template state: identical -> nothing twice,
#          new -> adopt, contradicting -> inbox (or a config-key resolution).
#
#          Split by design: this script does every *mechanical* judgement itself (new,
#          identical, dead/retired/stale identifiers, cross-file collisions, an own rule repeated
#          across files) and writes the result. Anything that needs *content* judgement — does an
#          imported rule merely restate, extend, or actually contradict one of this project's own
#          rules under a different identifier — it cannot decide alone: `plan` only proposes
#          candidate pairs (same area, own-rule/override text against the project's own-rule/
#          override text) for a model to look at; `apply` takes the verdicts back via --judgments
#          and only then writes. Without --judgments, a candidate pair is left "unreviewed" in the
#          inbox rather than silently applied.
#
#          Built on settings_format.py (parse/serialize, reused read-only), rules.py (project file
#          parser + the same [=]/[~]/[-]/[+] semantics), doctor.py's dead/retired-id corpus
#          (`doctor._build_corpus`, read-only reuse — nothing here writes through doctor.py), and
#          update.py's branch hint (`update._maybe_print_branch_hint`). See the settings file
#          spec ("Export and import") for the full detail.
#
# Usage:
#   python .act/scripts/settings_load.py plan [<file...>] [--candidates-out PATH] [--json]
#       Parse and mechanically check every given file (order = argument order) against the current
#       project and against each other. Writes nothing to the project; --candidates-out writes the
#       candidate-pair list for a model to judge (see "Candidates JSON" below) to that path.
#   python .act/scripts/settings_load.py apply [<file...>] [--judgments PATH] [--yes] [--non-interactive]
#                                               [--resolve FILE=ACTION ...]
#       Same analysis, then writes: new/identical/judged-non-contradicting rules into
#       docs/ai/rules.md / docs/project/coding_rules.md, bundled scripts/checklists/agents/
#       skills into docs/ai/local/<area>/<name> (shown before writing unless --yes) — an
#       agent/skill whose name matches a template role/skill is never written, only reported (it
#       would otherwise start overriding the template unit); a written own agent/skill then gets
#       the tool bridge the target project needs (.claude/agents/<name>.md, skill copies), via the
#       same mechanism init.py/update.py use for a template one — "## setup-required" lines
#       and every unresolved finding into one docs/ai/inbox/U<n>-settings-import.md. --judgments
#       supplies verdicts for the candidate pairs `plan --candidates-out` produced (see "Judgments
#       JSON" below); a candidate with no verdict stays unapplied and unreviewed in the inbox. A
#       contradiction is resolved automatically, without --judgments, only when
#       docs/ai/config.md sets `settings-conflict-<area>` to `project` or `import` — resolved
#       either way, but always reported, never silent. --resolve FILE=ACTION switches to an
#       entirely different mode that skips all of the above — see "Not fully processed files"
#       below.
#
# No <file...> given (either command): every `.md`/`.zip` directly under `.act-local/import/`
#   (machine-local, gitignored; created if it does not exist yet — README.md there is skipped),
#   sorted by name, is used instead. A file that fails to load (bad zip, unparsable settings.md) is
#   reported and left in place; the rest are still processed together, same as several files given
#   explicitly. `apply` (never `plan` — a dry run moves nothing) then moves every file it did manage
#   to load *and* fully resolve to `.act-local/import/done/`, appending a timestamp on a name
#   collision. "Fully resolve" means nothing from that file was left open (see "Not fully processed
#   files" below) — such a file stays in `.act-local/import/` instead. An empty or missing
#   import folder is a clean "nothing to do", exit 0. Explicit `<file...>` paths on the command line
#   are read from wherever given and are never moved, never offered to --resolve.
#
# Not fully processed files: a file stays in `.act-local/import/` when a plain `apply` (no
#   --resolve) left something of it open — a bundled script/checklist/agent/skill that needed --yes
#   or was declined or refused outright (risky frontmatter, shadowing, a bad path, ...), a candidate
#   pair nobody judged, or a name/id collision with something already in the project. `apply` prints
#   what is open (one line per item, with the reason) and what already applied, then either follows
#   `--resolve FILE=ACTION` (repeatable; FILE is the file's name in `.act-local/import/`; an unknown
#   FILE is a fatal error listing the files actually pending, nothing moved) or, on an interactive
#   run with no matching --resolve, asks the same question with `keep` as the default answer.
#
#   --resolve is a pure filing run, not a second attempt at applying anything: as soon
#   as it is given, every file in `.act-local/import/` not named in a --resolve is left completely
#   alone — not analyzed, not moved, not touched at all — and even a named file only gets the one
#   action asked for, nothing from it is applied. No TTY prompt ever happens in this mode (the whole
#   point of --resolve is to answer without one). --resolve together with an explicit <file...> on
#   the command line is a fatal error (there is nothing in `.act-local/import/` to file away).
#   ACTION is one of:
#     keep     (the default either way) — leave the file where it is, offered again next run.
#     partial  — close the file now. Nothing from it applies in this run (nothing does, in this
#                mode) — what it would still leave open is instead worked out with a read-only
#                check (the same analysis `plan` runs, against this file alone), and the file moves
#                to `.act-local/import/done/` with a `<name>.skipped.md` note next to it that names
#                those items, why, and the date of the decision. A file that fails to load at all
#                (bad zip, unparsable settings.md) cannot be given `partial` — there is nothing to
#                analyze — and is refused with a message pointing at keep/ignore/delete instead.
#     ignore   — move the file to `.act-local/import/ignored/`; files there are never offered again.
#                Works for a file that fails to load too.
#     delete   — remove the file outright. Only ever happens via an explicit `--resolve`/interactive
#                answer, never as a default. Works for a file that fails to load too.
#
# Candidates JSON (--candidates-out, and the "candidates" key of `plan --json`):
#   {"candidates": [{"key": "<area>:<import_id>::<target_id>", "area": "rules"|"coding",
#                     "import_file": "<source file>", "import_id": "...", "import_text": "...",
#                     "target_id": "...", "target_text": "..."}, ...]}
#   `key` is what --judgments looks entries up by.
#
# Judgments JSON (--judgments):
#   {"<key>": "same"|"extends"|"contradicts"|"unrelated", ...}
#   A key not listed counts as unjudged. "same"/"contradicts" hold the import entry back (the
#   latter unless a config key resolves it); "extends"/"unrelated" let it be applied.
#
# Output format:
#   plan (default): one section per finding kind, then the candidate pairs, then a summary line.
#     --json: {"findings": [...], "candidates": [...], "setup_required": [...], "counts": {...}}.
#   apply: one line per file/rule actually written, then the same finding sections for whatever
#     was held back, then the inbox file path if one was written, then a summary line.
#   Exit 0 always for a syntactically valid run (findings are not "errors" — that's the point of an
#   inbox); 2 on a fatal error (no .act/ found, an input file that will not parse), never a
#   traceback.

# Bundled files (agents / skills) — same new/same/collision shape as plan_files() above, but
# with rules a bare scripts/checklists file does not need:
#
#  - shape: an agent must be a flat "<name>.md" (Claude Code registers a role by that file, not a
#    subdirectory); a skill must be "<name>/<file...>" (a Skill.md lives inside its own folder).
#    Anything else is refused before anything is planned to be written — a nested "sub/x.md" used
#    to slip past the name check below (wrong `unit_name`) and then crash write_unit_bridges()
#    once write_files() had *already* written it (Errno 2 reading a bridge source that was never at
#    the path the crash assumed) — planning now happens for every unit before any of them is
#    allowed to write, and a shape violation is a finding, not a partial write.
#  - name check: Claude Code registers an agent/skill under its frontmatter `name`, not its file or
#    folder name — so both are checked against the template's own role/skill names (and, for
#    agents, their generated "-high" bump variants), case-insensitively, and a mismatch between the
#    frontmatter `name` and the file/folder name is refused too (a mismatch is confusing at best,
#    and would otherwise dodge the shadow check by picking an innocuous file name for a
#    template-shadowing frontmatter `name`, or vice versa).
#  - risky frontmatter: `permissionMode`/`hooks`/`mcpServers` on an agent, `allowed-tools`/`hooks`
#    on a skill — never written silently, even with `--yes`; reported so a human adds it by hand
#    if actually wanted. `tools`/`model` are only a review hint, not refused.
#
# A name colliding with a *template* unit is never written at all: docs/ai/local/agents/<name>.md
# and docs/ai/local/skills/<name>/ both already mean "override this template file/skill" elsewhere
# in this template (actlib.resolve(), init.py's copy_targets()) — silently placing an imported
# own agent/skill there under a template name would start overriding it, exactly what
# "never silently overwrite" forbids.
