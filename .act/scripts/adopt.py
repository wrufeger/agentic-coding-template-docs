#
# Purpose: Mechanical executor of an approved adoption table (skill `act-adopt`, steps
#          4 and 7). Runs from a template checkout against a
#          project that was sighted with adopt_scan.py and whose owner approved one action per
#          sighted source in <target>/.act-local/adopt/table.json. Decides nothing itself: every
#          row is validated strictly first, and the whole run is refused on the first doubt.
#            --apply   on a new branch "act-adopt": move every `legacy` row (and every old skill/
#                      agent that carries the name of a template unit) byte-identical to
#                      docs/ai/work/archive/legacy/<old path>, its AI-tool config path segments
#                      renamed first (legacy_rel()) so no tool reads the archived copy as
#                      its own configuration, then run init.py --target.
#            --finish  after the content step (skill act-adopt) marked every `adopt` row
#                      done: turn adopted ai-config files into bridges, remove adopted sources
#                      and `delete` rows, bridge adopted own skills/roles (targets under
#                      docs/ai/local/skills|agents/) the way act-load-settings does, drop
#                      .claude/settings.json entries that run a removed script, remove the
#                      act:default mark from adopt targets (docs/ai/config.md keeps it: values
#                      only, its text stays scaffold), bend dead references in docs/project/
#                      and docs/README.md to the new place (link targets only), write
#                      docs/ai/work/archive/legacy/_act-renames.md (old path -> renamed path table;
#                      not "README.md", which a `legacy` row for a project's own root README.md
#                      could land at) where a legacy path was renamed, run doctor.py, write one inbox
#                      report.
#          Never commits (moves and removals are staged by path only). Stdlib only.
#
# Usage:
#   python .act/scripts/adopt.py --target <project> --apply [--plan] [--language-docs <code>] [--language-chat <code|auto>]
#   python .act/scripts/adopt.py --target <project> --finish [--plan]
#   python .act/scripts/adopt.py --target <project> --abort [--plan] [--force]   # the way back
#   (--plan: validate and print what would happen, change nothing)
#
# Output format:
#   Plain text: a "refused:" block listing every problem (exit 1), or one line per action taken,
#   followed by the "nothing lost" accounting — one line per table row ("kept", "in legacy
#   (checksum ok)", "deleted", "at target: …", …) and a total line. Exit 0 on success, on a
#   --plan run and on an idempotent re-run ("already adopted" / "already finished"); 1 if the run
#   was refused or the accounting found a row that is neither at its target, in legacy, deleted
#   nor kept; 2 on a usage error (target missing, not a git repository).
#   State files, all under <target>/.act-local/adopt/: state.json (applied/finished, what moved
#   where), legacy-checksums.json (sha256 per moved file, before = after).

Source/test/content trees (first path segment): {', '.join(sorted(CONTENT_TREES))}, test*.

--apply: clean tree (untracked only under .act-local/), new branch {BRANCH} (an existing branch
  refuses; a recorded state prints it and exits 0), `legacy` rows moved byte-identical to
  {LEGACY_ROOT}/<old path> (sha256 before = after) — with every AI-tool config path segment
  renamed first (`.claude`/`.codex`/`.gemini`/`.cursor`/`.agents` -> `_claude`/…,
  `.github/agents`/`.github/prompts` -> `_agents`/`_prompts`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  -> `….legacy`, a `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`/`GEMINI.md` at any depth -> `….legacy`, so no tool
  reads the archived copy as its own configuration) — then staged by path; a git
  call that fails stops the run with no accounting. An old skill/agent carrying the name of a
  template unit, or a file at a place init.py writes itself (docs/ai/ skeleton, docs/ai/rules.md,
  docs/project/coding_rules.md, docs/README.md), moves there too unless it is a delete row
  (removed) — a kept file at such a place stays and init leaves it. Then init.py --target
  --non-interactive --no-commit (detected at runtime; only an init.py without that flag makes its
  own first commit instead); existing CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md stay until --finish.
--finish: every adopt row done with its target on disk; adopted ai-config files that init has a
  bridge for become that bridge (protected rows stay as they are), other adopted sources and
  delete rows removed (git rm); an adopt target docs/ai/local/skills/<name>/... or
  docs/ai/local/agents/<name>.md is an own unit and gets its tool copies/bridge like
  act-load-settings writes them (skill copies recorded in .act-lock.json § copies) — refused if
  <name> is a template unit's (that would be an override; a row note "override" leaves it to the
  template's copy mechanism); doctor.py, references to moved/removed paths, report
  docs/ai/inbox/report-<stamp>-adoption-report.md. A reference in {REFS_SCOPE}
  to a path that is gone — or to a folder the adoption leaves without any file — is bent to its
  new place (legacy copy, or the one successor of an adopt row), the link target only:
  the target of a Markdown link or of a reference definition `[x]: path` (relative stays
  relative, anchor kept); no other text changes, code blocks never. A path in backticks is text:
  never changed, only listed ("mention in text — not changed") with both readings, relative to
  the file and to the root. The full list, bent and left with the reason, goes to
  {REFS_FILE} (--finish --plan: {REFS_PLAN_FILE},
  the terminal gets the counts); the report lists it inline up to {REFS_IN_REPORT} lines. Hook commands and
  Bash(...) permission rules in {SETTINGS_FILE} whose executed script (the first word of a
  command, or the word after python/bash/node/… or "$VAR"; bare, ./ or $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/ path)
  lies at or below a gone delete or legacy row are removed — an emptied hook group or event with
  them, nothing else changes, line endings kept; a script that is only an argument, Read/Edit/
  Write rules and entries on scripts still on disk never. Listed for removal by hand instead: a
  file whose layout json.dumps cannot reproduce, an entry whose script was already missing before
  the adoption or went with an adopt row, a statusLine, and {SETTINGS_LOCAL}.
  An adopt target (or a file below one that changed since --apply) whose line 1 is
  <!-- act:default --> loses that line — except docs/ai/config.md (values adopted, its text
  stays scaffold to translate).
  {LEGACY_README} (act:default, old path -> renamed path table) is written when at least one
  legacy path was renamed; nothing when none was.
  --finish --plan shows all of it first. A second --finish says "already finished".
  An adopt target that still has the content it had right after --apply, or that only
  adopt_config.py changed since (its hash as recorded in {ADOPT_DIR}/config-touched.json), is
  refused ("content not adopted?").
--apply with an adopt row of class project-doc, ai-machinery, predecessor or unknown that has no
  target: refused unless --confirm-no-targets is given (the owner's yes) — without a target recorded
  at --apply, --finish cannot refuse a row whose content was never carried over. ai-config and work
  rows never need one (their content becomes proposals and entries). --apply --plan prints the warning and goes on.
--apply --language-docs <code> --language-chat <code|auto>: passed on to init.py, so the
  docs language and the init todos are right from the start. They are recorded in state.json
  ("languages") and adopt_config.py keeps them; it sets `language-docs` from an old AI-CONFIG.md
  only where none was given.
--apply refuses a detached HEAD. It backs up .claude/settings.json (init.py merges hooks into it).
--abort: the way back after --apply or a stopped --apply, resumable (state.json is rewritten after
  every step). Refused while {BRANCH} carries a commit other than init.py's, and while work was
  done since --apply — a changed file init.py created, an uncommitted edit to a tracked file, a
  new file where a moved unit returns — unless --force, which first copies those files to
  {ABORTED_ROOT}/<path> and lists them. Then: removes the files init.py created that are
  unchanged (or saved), puts moved units back only from a legacy copy that still holds the moved
  content, puts rescued files back, checks out the base branch, restores the settings backup,
  deletes {BRANCH} and the state. New files it did not create are left in place and listed.
