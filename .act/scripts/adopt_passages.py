#
# Purpose: Mechanical insertion of an adopted project's own passages into
#          docs/project/coding_rules.md and docs/README.md (skill `act-adopt`, step 6, "Files
#          outside the entry system"). The model — or the worker preparing a batch for it — has
#          already cut the passage byte-identical from the old source and decided that it is the
#          project's own text, not the predecessor template's (step 2's diff); this script does not
#          re-decide any of that. It only does the two things a human hand-edit got wrong once:
#          shift every heading in the passage down by the same number of
#          levels (the old top level becomes "###" in coding_rules.md, "##" in docs/README.md,
#          exactly as the skill's table says) and insert the shifted text at the fixed place — the
#          end of the "Own rules" section (after its `<!-- act:own-rules -->` mark and comment
#          line) for coding_rules.md, the end of the file for docs/README.md — while preserving the
#          target file's own line endings (a `\r\n` file stays `\r\n`) and everything already there.
#          Re-running with the same passages file is a no-op: the exact shifted block, once found
#          already in place, is never inserted twice. Stdlib only.
#
# Usage:
#   python .act/scripts/adopt_passages.py --target <dir> --into coding --from <passages.md> --plan
#   python .act/scripts/adopt_passages.py --target <dir> --into coding --from <passages.md>
#   python .act/scripts/adopt_passages.py --target <dir> --into readme --from <passages.md> [--plan]
#
# `--into coding`  -> docs/project/coding_rules.md, inserted at the end of the "Own rules" section,
#                     old top heading level shifted to "###" (a passage with no heading of its own
#                     is inserted as is, unshifted); a "*" or "+" list marker at the start of a line
#                     (outside code fences) becomes "-", so the list is read as own rules.
# `--into readme`  -> docs/README.md, appended at the end of the file, old top heading level
#                     shifted to "##".
#
# `--from` names a UTF-8 file holding the passage(s) exactly as cut from the old source (several
# spans may already be concatenated there, in their original order) — never text retyped by a
# model. A leading BOM is stripped; the file's own line endings do not matter, the target file's do.
#
# Output format:
#   "already present, nothing to do" (exit 0) if the shifted block is already at its place; one
#   line naming the target, the insertion point and the number of lines, then "inserted" (write) or
#   "would insert" (--plan), exit 0. A schema problem in the target file (marker not found for
#   `--into coding`) or a missing/unreadable file: one line on stderr, exit 1; a bad command line:
#   exit 2.
