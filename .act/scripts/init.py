# Purpose: Turn a checkout of this template into a project ("here, in this clone"), or dock onto
#          an existing/empty directory ("--target"). Ten steps, always in the same order: collect
#          config values, resolve git (origin/branch -- in-place, the old history moves to a
#          'template' branch and 'main' is rebuilt as an orphan; once the first commit below has
#          landed on it, 'template' is deleted outright so nobody can merge it back into 'main',
#          once the first commit has landed), check git identity, write the per-checkout workspace identity, thin the
#          bridges down to the chosen tools, materialize skeleton + bridges (plus skill copies and
#          role bridges, see copy_targets()/agent_bridge_targets(); in-place, a root CLAUDE.md/
#          AGENTS.md still carrying the template's own bootstrap marker is replaced by its project
#          bridge here too, see _bootstrap_entry_files/TEMPLATE_BOOTSTRAP_MARKER -- --target never
#          has one to replace), append .gitattributes/.gitignore, retire the template's own
#          README(s) and LICENSE (skipped in --target mode -- nothing of the template's own there
#          to decide, only .act/ was copied in), write the lock/cache state, and make the first
#          commit. Never overwrites a file the project already has; anything that needs a decision
#          but can't be asked (non-interactive run) is written to docs/ai/inbox/ instead of guessed.
#          A `language-docs` other than English leaves the scaffold English (marked `act:default`)
#          plus one inbox entry asking to translate it (R-work-language) — init has no model to do
#          that itself. Stdlib only.
#
# Usage:
#   python .act/scripts/init.py                      # set up the current checkout in place
#   python .act/scripts/init.py --target <path>       # create/dock in another directory instead
#   python .act/scripts/init.py --plan                # show the ten steps, change nothing
#   python .act/scripts/init.py --non-interactive      # never prompt; take defaults, log to inbox
#   python .act/scripts/init.py --language-docs de     # docs language without asking (default en);
#                                                      # --language-chat <code|auto> likewise
#   python .act/scripts/init.py --no-commit            # do everything except the final commit
#
# Output format: one numbered line per step ("[n/10] ..."), 1..10, plus a closing "[act] done"
#   line. Exit 0 on success (a --plan run included), 1 if a fatal precondition is not met (e.g.
#   --target points at an unwritable path).

    `_SKILLS_NOT_COPIED` is the one exception: act-adopt only makes sense pointed at the template

    with no bridge yet has nothing written. Only "claude-code" has a bridge format today; a tool
    without one is simply never a target.

    Unlike copy_targets(), the destination file is never replaced once written (see
    step_materialize below and update.py's step 6): init creates it once, update only adds bridges
    for roles new since the last run, and an existing bridge is the project's own from that point

    below the frontmatter never needs to change after the fact. The one exception, handled by
    write_agent_bridge_file() below rather than here, is the `model`/`effort` frontmatter pair
    itself: re-derived from `.act/tiers.json`/`docs/ai/config.md` § Roles on every `update` and at
    every session start (see tiers.py's refresh_project_bridge_frontmatter()).

    A project's *own* role — a docs/ai/local/agents/<name>.md file with no .act/agents/<name>.md

    is that role's docs/ai/local/ override (a different file shape — plain rules text, no
    frontmatter) and is not a bridge source in its own right — and neither is a name matching a
