# Purpose: Local usage counter — how often each role starts, at which tier/model; how often
#          each skill, slash command, script and checklist is used; how a worker's outcome turned
#          out at acceptance time. Feeds two later mechanisms without any extra bookkeeping of
#          their own: the tips-that-fade-once-a-feature-is-used condition `unused:<key>`
#          (is_unused() below) and the
#          per-role/tier tier proposal (roles.<name>.outcomes below, via
#          --outcome). Stdlib only. Never sent anywhere (only the *pattern*, not this project's
#          own numbers, ever goes
#          out — via the ordinary Feedback mechanism, not this script).
#
# Store: .act-local/usage.json (gitignored — decided: purely local, see above).
#        Recording never touches that file directly, though — see "Concurrency" below and
#        .act/hooks/checks/usage.py's own header (the observer that calls record_event() for
#        every hook event). Both files' headers are meant to be read together; this one owns the
#        schema, the consolidation step and the CLI, checks/usage.py only turns hook events into
#        the tiny per-occurrence files this file folds in.
#
# Usage:
#   python .act/scripts/usage.py                          # same as --show
#   python .act/scripts/usage.py --show
#   python .act/scripts/usage.py --outcome <role> <tier> accepted|reworked|escalated
#   python .act/scripts/usage.py --unused <key>
#   python .act/scripts/usage.py --reset
#
# Output format:
#   --show:    one line per category with any entries ("Roles:", "Skills:", ...), one indented
#              line per key ("  builder: 4x, 2026-09-21..2026-09-23 tiers=standard:4
#              models=?:4"); "(no usage recorded yet)" if the store is empty. Exit 0 always.
#   --outcome: "usage: <role>/<tier> outcome recorded: <outcome>", exit 0; exit 2 with a message
#              on stderr for an unrecognized outcome word; exit 1 (rare) if the consolidate lock
#              could not be acquired in time — nothing was recorded, safe to just retry.
#   --unused:  "usage: <key> is unused|used"; exit 0 if never recorded (the tip may fire), exit 1
#              if it was (the tip stays quiet) — a shell-friendly inversion of the usual "0 means
#              found", picked to match the CLI contract this task's order specifies verbatim.
#   --reset:   "usage: reset (<n> file(s) removed)", exit 0.
#
# Schema of .act-local/usage.json:
#   {"version": 1,
#    "roles":      {"<role>": {"count": n, "first_used": "YYYY-MM-DD", "last_used": "...",
#                               "tiers": {"<tier-or-''>": n, ...}, "models": {"<model-or-''>": n},
#                               "outcomes": {"<tier-or-''>": {"accepted": n, "reworked": n,
#                                                              "escalated": n}}}},
#    "skills":     {"<skill>":     {"count": n, "first_used": ..., "last_used": ...}},
#    "commands":   {"<command>":   {"count": n, "first_used": ..., "last_used": ...}},
#    "scripts":    {"<script>":    {"count": n, "first_used": ..., "last_used": ...}},
#    "checklists": {"<checklist>": {"count": n, "first_used": ..., "last_used": ...}},
#    "checks":     {"<check>":     {"count": n, "first_used": ..., "last_used": ...,
#                                    "kinds": {"<kind>": n, ...}}}}
#   An empty string key ("" under "tiers"/"models") means "no Tier: line found in the prompt" /
#   "tool_input.model was absent" — kept distinct from an actual value, on purpose, so a tip or a
#   report can tell "workers of this role never carry a tier" from "they always run 'light'".
#
# is_unused(root, key) — the `unused:<key>` tip condition (not built here):
#   `key` is either bare ("reviewer", "act-a11y", "deps", "worker-cap") — matched against every
#   category, first hit in category order (roles, skills, commands, scripts, checklists, checks)
#   wins — or prefixed with one of those exact category names and a colon ("skills:act-a11y") to
#   pin it to one category, for the rare case where the same bare name is used in more than one
#   (e.g. a skill and a checklist sharing a name). Returns True ("unused", tip may fire) iff no
#   matching entry has count > 0 anywhere it was looked up. Consolidates first, so an occurrence
#   from the last few seconds — still only a pending event file — already counts.
#
# record(kind, key) — the one entry point a PreToolUse check (.act/hooks/checks/*.py) calls itself
#   to count a cap-hit or a denial, since the observer in checks/usage.py runs *before* the checks
#   (dispatch.py's fixed order) and so never sees them. One line for a check to add:
#       import usage; usage.record("denied", "worker-cap")
#   `kind` is the check's own short word for what happened ("cap_hit", "denied", ...), `key` its
#   name as it appears in docs/ai/config.md's Checks table. Folded into the "checks" category's
#   "kinds" sub-count (see schema above). Best-effort, like every write in this module: never
#   raises, so a bookkeeping failure can never put a check's own 0/2 PreToolUse contract at risk.
#
# Concurrency: recording (record_event()/record()) never opens usage.json — see .act/hooks/checks/
# usage.py's header for why (many dispatch.py processes can run at once; a shared JSON file
# updated read-modify-write per event would lose updates the same way checks/write_scope.py's own
# docstring documents, t26_race.py, 2026-09-23 review). Both instead call _write_event(), which
# gives each occurrence its own file under .act-local/usage/events/, named by tempfile.mkstemp and
# placed with os.replace (atomic on POSIX and Windows alike) — N parallel occurrences always
# produce N files, never a lost one, whatever order the processes finish in.
#
# Consolidation (folding those files into the single usage.json) is the one place that does
# read-modify-write on shared state, so it runs under a lock: .act-local/usage/consolidate.lock,
# taken with os.O_CREAT|os.O_EXCL (atomic create-if-absent on POSIX and Windows alike, same
# technique a PID-file lock uses) and released by unlinking it. Three independent callers can
# reach consolidation — the CLI (--show/--outcome/--unused), is_unused() and, since the 2026-09-23
# review (point 1: an unbounded events/ directory otherwise grows forever, point 5: cmd_outcome
# used to consolidate() and then _write_store() as two separate operations, so a second process's
# consolidate() could land its own write in between and be silently overwritten) — the observer's
# own SessionStart handler (checks/usage.py's observe(), consolidate_at_session_start() below).
# _acquire_lock() bounds how long a caller waits for the lock (lock_timeout) and treats a lock file
# older than 60s as abandoned by a crashed process (unlinks it and retries) — a lock is only ever
# held for the few milliseconds a fold-and-write takes, so anything older is orphaned, not merely
# slow. A caller that still cannot get the lock within its own timeout fails open: consolidate()
# returns the last-written store unchanged (never blocks, never guesses); the mutate-carrying path
# (consolidate_and_mutate(), used by --outcome) instead returns None, so cmd_outcome can tell "not
# recorded" from "recorded" rather than print success for a mutation that never happened.
# consolidate()'s own docstring names the one race the *locked* path still accepts (a crash
# between writing the consolidated file and deleting the folded event files re-folds — double-
# counts — those same files next time, rather than losing them) — acceptable for a nudge counter,
# not for anything billed on this number.
