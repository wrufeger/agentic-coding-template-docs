#
# Purpose: Read the *effective* rules — the template's rule sets after the project's own
#          checkboxes, replacements and additions are applied. One script, one parser, for both
#          rule areas: coding rules (template source .act/coding/<set>.md, project file
#          docs/project/coding_rules.md, IDs "CR-...") and core rules (template source
#          .act/rules/**/*.md, project file docs/ai/rules.md, IDs "R-..."). Both areas use the
#          same schema, described below.
#
#          The parser reads only the language-neutral marks a project file can contain — a
#          checkbox, "use:", a backticked ID, "replaces", an "@path"/"`path`" set reference — and
#          never the surrounding headings or prose, which stay in the project's own language.
#
# Usage:
#   python .act/scripts/rules.py                        # effective rule text for an AI, area=coding
#   python .act/scripts/rules.py --area core             # same, for docs/ai/rules.md
#   python .act/scripts/rules.py --list                  # human overview, one line per set/group
#   python .act/scripts/rules.py CR-nuxt-basics           # one group in full, with its origin
#   python .act/scripts/rules.py --validate               # schema + cross-checks, exit 1 on any finding
#   python .act/scripts/rules.py --imports [--from FILE]  # which files Claude Code loads from CLAUDE.md
#
# Output format:
#   Default and <id>: Markdown, meant to be pasted into a model's context.
#   --list: "[symbol] id — summary" per set, one indented "[symbol] id[ — reason]" per group below
#     it (symbols: "=" unchanged, "~" overridden, "-" switched off, "+" own addition).
#   --validate: one finding per line as "<path>:<line>: <message>", nothing printed and exit 0 if
#     there are no findings. Text under "Own rules" that is not read as a rule (a heading, prose, a
#     table, a code fence) follows as "<path>:<line>: note: <message>", one per run of such lines —
#     a note never changes the exit code. Own rules are "- ", "* " or "+ " bullets.
#   --imports: "reached <n>:" and one indented root-relative path per file Claude Code loads, in
#     load order, then "unresolved <n>:" and one "<file>:<line>: @<target> — <reason>" per import
#     it cannot follow (exit 1 if there is any). Same rule as Claude Code: relative to the
#     importing file, at most four hops below the start file, never inside a code span or block.
#   Errors (unknown area, missing project file, unknown id, bad arguments): one line on stderr,
#     exit 1 (2 for a bad command line), never a traceback.
