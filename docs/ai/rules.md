# Rules

Yours to change: uncheck a rule to switch it off, drop an import line to switch off its whole
area, add your own below (`R-work-override`). The imported files load whole, so an unchecked rule
is **off** — ignore its text even though it is loaded. A `replaces` line below wins over the
template text of its rule, checked or not.

## Shared — every role, including sub-agents

Imports resolve relative to this file (`docs/ai/`), hence the `../../`. Check what Claude Code
actually loads with `python .act/scripts/rules.py --imports`.
